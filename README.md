# explorer-python
a complex game set in a world where fighting, corruption and profit are king
featuring incredible modding support which is relatively quick and easy - just edit some text files

Roadmap:
v0001:
- Can fight creatures + dismember them - dismemberment has no effects but death at this stage
- Can go to shops - which apparently are in the middle of nowhere - and buy weapons using currency looted from creatures
- Can die if essential body part gets dismembered
- Connected body parts fall off along with the parent
- Can save/load character.
- can mod in starting player bodies, body parts and enemies
- rudimentary currency - just described as coins - will be changed later on
v0002:
- Dismemberment has side effects - blood loss, loss of accuracy, unconsciousness. 
- Can knock/be knocked unconscious - you/the enemy gets multiple turns in a row
- can miss shots if accuracy is poor or weapon is too heavy for you
- can die/fall unconscious from blood loss - lose many big parts and you're done for
- weapons deal different types of damage now - swords slash, hammers whack, daggers stab
- sharp weapons cause additional blood loss on attack, but blunter weapons have more force behind them
- can render parts useless through mangling them
- character can get hungry - no cure at this time, hunger cannot kill in this version

v0003:
- dismembered parts fall to the environment - a new area around the character which can be interacted with 
- shops now have an environment - you have to walk around to pick up items
- steal from shops and get labelled a thief - not allowed in shops for a long time
- shops now sell food at varying qualities 
- organs are now included in fighting - certain body parts hold organs, and organs have effects
- destroying the stomach makes eating nigh impossible and you barely gain any nutrition from food. 
- other organs just kill you if destroyed. brain damage makes you more susceptable to unconsciousness
- enemies now have intelligence - they won't randomly pick a part, they'll choose a part that they can reach and has the highest chance to kill you - usually the head
- hunger can kill - but you can obtain food now

v0004:
- CANNIBALISM - eat dismembered parts and bodies for nutrition.....and several side effects will definitely occur!
- effects include brain damage and vomiting
- VOMITING - a negative effect which occurs either from a liver shot or eating bad food - causes you to lose a turn and reduces your water + blood levels
- THIRST - can get thirsty - drink water or blood to regain water saturation
- character and enemies can now equip armor - provides protection against all weapons, but mostly against sharper weapons
- environmental effects - heatstroke and hypothermia. both make you weaker, with a few differences
- can go to hospitals to repair body parts and pay for organ replacements. cannot recover limbs yet

v0005:
- tavern - view the stories of previous characters - before they died. also see procedurally generated drinks made from procedurally generated plants. 
- materials - everything is now made of a material - materials adjust properties of the material e.g. skin is easy to pierce. 
- cleanliness - must keep equipment and yourself clean - otherwise...
- DISEASE + INFECTIONS - potential to get infected, covering body part with pus and possibly losing said part. more likely on small parts + parts that are non-essential
- hospitals can now treat diseases, infections and replace destroyed/lost limbs with wooden crude versions that don't work!
- enemies/npcs now have random ailments/lost body parts to increase immersion.
- scarring is now possible - high damage attacks have the potential to scar parts - some parts are more susceptible than others
- can now drink alcohol - causes several bad effects on the battlefield. bar fights can now occur as well

v0006:
- drugs exist - can have adverse side effects if not careful when using them
- drugs are quite expensive from shops 
- some drugs have different effects to others
- some drugs are recreational in use only and only boost mood, others improve combat performance, and others have niche uses. 
- pain system - player + enemies can feel pain
- procedurally generated alcohol now ties into the drug system, and has random effects which are unique to the random flower. 
- random flowers can now be found in the environment and collected.

v0007:
- new world environment - yay environments outside of shops and battles
- shop environment is seamless with world environment
- construction! - currently can build brewing barrels, storage barrels and tool sharpening stations
- sharp weapons blunt over time - either visit a blacksmith or build a tool sharpening station
- certain shops now sell construction materials 
- random flowers are now priced up depending on potency, rarity and effects and are sold in shops in bulk quantities
- some flowers now produce the same type of alcohol as other flowers
- npc/enemy naming system - produces strings that follow basic english language rules

v0008:
- shops can now be part of a corporation or chain
- corporations own shops - shops deliver profits to them
- chains are corporations with only one specific shop type
- shops can specialise more now - some even sell just one or two items
- bar fights are more complicated - they generate a backstory between two characters and pick a reason why they are fighting
- more foliage in the world - grass, trees, fallen leaves. 
- PLUGIN_MANAGER V1 - allows the game to run plugins upon opening game, and gives them contextual information that could be used in many different ways
- plugins are also given the ability to edit the world and the environment on the next tick, as plugins can write to a .txt file and the game will read it the next tick and delete

v0009:
- oceans! can encounter large bodies of water on your travels
- shipwreaks on shorelines - can find valuable goodies
- commodities - valuable trinkets with little to no use other than trading.
- character traits - become frail, a heavy drinker, light on your feet
- snow in high places

v0010:
- can now own property in towns/villages/cities
- more buildings! build walls, doors, windows, chests and industrial brewing barrels
- npcs now have drug preferences - most hate all drugs but alcohol and then within the category of alcohol people like certain types more than others
- can now haggle with npcs
- ZOMBIES: creatures that are infected with the zombie plague - don't die till you destroy/dismember the brain! (dismembering the brain will create a weak zombie head which will continue to attack you)
- corpses now rot - some rot into animated skeletons, weak enemies with many uses that will be explored in future updates

v0011:
- CRYPTS: spooky dungeon environments which are cold and wet. Inhabited by armored animated skeletons
- crypts have good loot and many coins. 
- seasons. experience snow in low areas in winter. also changes environmental effects and means that you must wear thermal protection during summer and winter. 
- agriculture - random flowers now have growing periods and require certain soils - affects rarity and price of alcohols.
- more traits: good haggler, quick builder, bone shatterer (makes skeletons easier to kill but also makes you more prone to damage)
- more replaceable body parts avaliable

v0012:
- TBA
